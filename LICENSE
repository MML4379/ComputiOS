### 9. Termination

Any violation of these terms automatically terminates your rights to use, access, or reference the Software. The Author reserves the right to pursue legal action for violations of this license.

### 10. Commercial OS Licensing and OEM Agreements

For commercial use of the Core OS, OEM agreements, hardware pre-installation, or other special licensing arrangements, contact the Author by emailing [mailto:michael@mmltech.net](michael@mmltech.net).

Application developers do NOT need special permission for commercial Applications.

### 11. Amendments

The Author reserves the right to modify these license terms at any time. Continued use of the Software constitutes acceptance of any modified terms.

### 12. License Clarification by Component

For clarity, here is how this license applies to different parts of the repository:

**Restrictive (Core OS) License Applies To:**
- `/kernel` - Kernel source code
- `/bootloader` - Boot system
- `/drivers` - System drivers
- Core system utilities and components

**Permissive (System Libraries) License Applies To:**
- `/libcpos` - System libraries
- `/sdk` - Software development kit
- `/include` - API headers and interfaces
- `/examples` - Example application code

When in doubt, assume the more restrictive Core OS license applies unless the component is explicitly listed as using the permissive System Libraries license.
